# Code for "Conversations at Scale: Robust AI-led Interviews with a Simple Open-Source Platform"

## What it Does
This project is designed as an AI-led interview platform specifically tailored for the Business Studies Internship program at Leiden University. It facilitates self-reflection for students by guiding them through structured interviews based on their learning objectives, progress, challenges, and future career aspirations. The platform supports the mandatory self-reflection interviews required for the internship report, including the analysis of AI's impact on business operations and industry trends.

## How it Works
The platform is built using Streamlit and integrates with OpenAI or Anthropic APIs to conduct real-time AI-led interviews. It supports Google Drive integration for saving interview transcripts and timing data, as well as email functionalities for sharing transcripts.

### Key Features:
- Structured interview flow aligned with the Business Studies Internship Handbook.
- Real-time AI interaction for open-ended discussions and follow-up questions.
- Automatic saving of interview transcripts and timing data on Google Drive.
- Email notifications to students and additional recipients.
- Compatibility with both OpenAI (GPT) and Anthropic (Claude) models.

## Environment Setup and Configuration
The platform is built using Streamlit and requires the following configuration settings:

### Required Environment Variables:
- `API_KEY`: API key for OpenAI or Anthropic.
- `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`: Google Service Account credentials for Drive integration.
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: Password for the email account used to send transcripts.
- `ENV`: Environment setting (`test` or `production`).
- `DISABLE_EMAIL`: (Optional) Set to `True` to disable email notifications.

### Google API Integration
The platform uses Google Drive to store transcripts and timing data. Ensure you:
- Enable the Google Drive API.
- Create a Google Service Account and download the JSON key file.
- Store the JSON key in `.streamlit/secrets.toml` under the key `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`.
- Share the Google Drive folder with the service account email.

### Email Configuration
- Uses Gmail's SMTP server (`smtp.gmail.com` on port `587`).
- Requires enabling 'Less secure app access' or setting up an App Password in Gmail.
- Store the email password in `.streamlit/secrets.toml` under `EMAIL_PASSWORD`.

## Installation Guide
1. Install Miniconda (if not already installed).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the `code` directory.
4. Create the environment: `conda env create -f interviewsenv.yml`
5. Activate the environment: `conda activate interviews`
6. Start the platform: `streamlit run interview.py`

## Usage Guide
1. Navigate to the Streamlit URL provided in the terminal.
2. Log in using your assigned credentials.
3. Conduct the interview following the structured flow.
4. End the interview to automatically save the transcript and timing data.
5. An email notification will be sent if configured.

# Instructions from the old repo

There are two options to explore the AI-led interviews discussed in the paper.

## Option 1: Online notebook

To try own ideas for interviews within minutes and without the need to install Python, see https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sYl2BMiZACrOMlyASuT-bghCwS5FxHSZ (requires to obtain an API key)

## Option 2: Full platform

To install Python and set up the full interview platform locally (takes around 1h from scratch), see the following steps.

The interview platform is built using the library `streamlit` and the APIs of OpenAI and Anthropic.

- Download miniconda from https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install/ and install it (skip if `conda` is already installed)
- Obtain an API key from https://platform.openai.com/ or https://www.anthropic.com/api. In case of the OpenAI API, choose a "project" key
- Download this repository
- In the repository folder on your computer, paste your API key into the file `/code/.streamlit/secrets.toml` (requires to make hidden folders visible)
- In the config.py, select a language model and adjust the interview outline
- In Terminal (Mac) or Anaconda Prompt (Windows), navigate to the folder `code` with `cd` (if unclear, briefly look up basic Linux command line syntax for navigating to folders)
- Once in the `code` folder, create the environment from the .yml file by writing `conda env create -f interviewsenv.yml` and confirming with enter (this installs Python and all libraries necessary to run the platform; only needs to be done once)
- Activate the environment with `conda activate interviews`
- Start the platform with `streamlit run interview.py`
